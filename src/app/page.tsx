            Weâ€™re a youth composite mountain biking team located in
            Fredericksburg, Virginia. Our goal is to get more kids on bikes and
            build the foundation for a lifelong enjoyment of riding and having
            fun outdoors.

          <p className="mb-3">
            We participate in two racing seasons for student athletes who are
            interested in racing, and we will prepare all student athletes of
            all riding abilities for the racing scene.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            That being said, student athletes are not required to race. Mountain
            Bike racing is a unique team environment where there are no cuts and
            there is no bench; everyone rides and contributes to the team no
            matter their ability level or interest in competition.
